## Course Overview

In this course, we delve into advanced techniques for analyzing and forecasting time series data. We explore various models and methodologies specifically designed to handle the complexities often associated with time-dependent data. By the end of the course, you'll have a solid understanding of advanced time series concepts and be equipped with practical skills to tackle real-world time series problems.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to time series analysis
- Time series decomposition
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models
- Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models
- Exponential smoothing methods
- Vector Autoregression (VAR) models
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting
- Time series cross-validation techniques
- Advanced topics in time series analysis

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:
